# Brain Fun
Winning entry for the York Instruments hackathon at the University of York in June 2017, developed in C# using Unity.

The aim of the hackathon was to create something unique with HDF5 data-sets of brain scans that were provided. I created an application which would build the head of the patient out of a series of nodes, which would then change in size and color depending on the activity of that area of the brain at that point in time.
